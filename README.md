# Gloomhaven Card Viewer

https://www.gloomhavencards.com

I started playing Gloomhaven recently and was looking for a site that displayed all the character ability and item cards in a way that way easy to read, sort, filter, and search. There were a couple I found out there but they didn't seem very polished so I decided to make my own.

The UI was inspired by a popular site I used for searching Magic the Gathering cards and the images were pulled from https://github.com/any2cards/worldhaven.

**Features**

* All character ability and item cards from base game
* Sort and Filter options
* Card searching (by name)
* Spoiler configuration (It should save your spoiler configuration in your browser's storage so it persists when you return)
