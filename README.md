# Gloomhaven Card Browser

https://www.gloomhavencards.com

I started playing Gloomhaven recently and was looking for a site to browse character ability and item cards. There were a couple I found out there but they didn't seem very polished or didn't unify ability and item cards. So I decided to make my own!

The UI was inspired by a [popular site](https://scryfall.com/) I used for searching Magic the Gathering cards and the images were pulled from [worldhaven](https://github.com/any2cards/worldhaven).

The app was created using the [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) react framework leveraging Server Side Rendering wherever possible and deployed using [vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you'd like to run the app locally, clone the repo and run `npm run dev`.

## Features

- Content from base game, Forgotten Circles, Jaws of the Lion, and Crimson Scales (Frosthaven coming in the future...)
- Character Ability Cards (including Character Mats & Sheets)
- Item cards
- Sort and Filter options
- Persistent spoiler configuration
